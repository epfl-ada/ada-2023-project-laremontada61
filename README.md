### Requirements
Although all of our notebooks are pre-runed, we would recommand you to create a `virtual environment`` to load all the necessary libraries.
### Abstract
In the wide world of hops, cereals and aperitifs with friends, LaRemontADA is on a quest towards making a beer rating system combining the precision of figures and the richness of prose.

Using the [BeerReviews]() dataset that contains a variety of beer ratings from 2 different websites together with sentiment analysis tools, out goal is to enhance the already existing rating system to be able to determine the world's best beer. This determination is based on a detailed analysis of the existing ratings throughout the world and across time.

### Research questions
During this work, we will give an answer to those questions:

- How to enrich the ranking systems with sentiment analysis ?
- Are there any external factors that may influence rating ? (such as politics, economics, time of the year...)
- Combining all of this, what is the best brewery in the world ?
