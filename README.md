### üíª Requirements
Although all of our notebooks are pre-runed, we would recommand you to create a `virtual environment`` to load all the necessary libraries.

### üìñ Abstract
In the wide world of hops, cereals and aperitifs with friends, LaRemontADA is on a quest towards making a beer rating system combining the precision of figures and the richness of prose.

Using the [BeerReviews]() dataset that contains a variety of beer ratings from 2 different websites together with sentiment analysis tools, out goal is to enhance the already existing rating system to be able to determine the world's best beer. This determination is based on a detailed analysis of the existing ratings throughout the world and across time.

### ‚ùì Research questions
During this work, we will give an answer to those questions:

- How to enrich the ranking systems with sentiment analysis ?
- Are there any external factors that may influence rating ? (such as politics, economics, time of the year...)
- Combining all of this, what is the best brewery in the world ?

### üéØ Methods
In order to answer the research question and get to our goal, you can read hereafter the proposed pipeline:

Firstly, correct the ratings based on the reviews is our first goal, we will use the textual reviews from each user to establish a profile of the user's scoring style. The profile will be defined according to its subjectivity, its hardness or the polarity of its opinion. With this data gathered for each user, we would like to correct via linear regression the numerical scores by, for example, reducing the weight of scores judged to be subjective or readjusting excessively harsh scores.

Secondly, we would like to give a visual representation of the variability in the ranking of the best beers according to geographical area or season. In order to do this, we will use data aggregation methods along side with statistical studies on the ratings to extract significant variability.
