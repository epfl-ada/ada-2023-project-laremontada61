title: Brewing a fair beer rating system üçª
---

# Context
In today's era, we have the ability to rate a wide range of things, such as restaurants, movies, or beers. Numerous websites enable users to share their opinions through numerical ratings and textual reviews. However, as consumers, relying solely on numerical ratings can be challenging to get a comprehensive understanding of a product. Reading through all textual reviews for detailed information is time-consuming, and subjective opinions further complicate the evaluation process. 
The problem intensifies when certain products are either unfairly favored or disadvantaged due to the subjectivity of reviewers. This undermines the credibility of the ranking system, as products not reviewed by these subjective individuals might be unfairly influenced in either a positive or negative manner. 
In summary, the current approach of relying solely on numerical ratings and extensive textual reviews poses challenges for consumers in obtaining a clear and unbiased picture of a product.

Understanding the fairness of ratings is crucial to ensure fairness among products. Our aim is to create a fair beer rating system that can be applied to different rating systems. We'll explore how the subjective nature of reviews affects both the sentiment (polarity) and numerical ratings of beers, revealing genuine differences in diverse reviews. This investigation will use thorough statistical tests. The result will be a new ranking system that combines written reviews and numerical ratings, offering a more complete and fair evaluation approach.
